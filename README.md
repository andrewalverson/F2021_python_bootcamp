## Fall 2021 DASC Python/R Bootcamp

### Day 1: Python

We'll use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run Python code inside of Jupyter notebooks

You'll need to clone this GitHub repository. It will help to copy and paste this web address:

	https://github.com/andrewalverson/F2021_python_bootcamp

We'll cover the following basic concepts and operations in Python:
	
- variables

- integers, floats, and strings

- basic math, adding numbers and strings

- how to build, use, slice, and index lists

- how to open, read, and parse a file
	
	- with open() as:

	- for loops

	- next()

- conditionals (if, elif, else)

- how to format and print output
	
	- f'' vs. print()
	
	- '+' vs. ','

- how to use Google to find help

### Day 2: R

#### Introduction to R and the tidyverse

[Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html):

1. Each variable must have its own column.

2. Each observation must have its own row.

3. Each value must have its own cell.

##### Basic concepts

- [dataframe](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame): 2-dimensional table; the fundamental data structure in R
	
	- **columns** are variables that can differ in type (numeric, factor, character, etc.)
	
	- **rows** are observations of the different variable types described by the column name/header
	
	- each piece of data is called a **cell** 

- [%>%](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html): pipe â€“ channel the output of what's before the pipe to the command after the pipe

- [filter()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html): use to extract a subset of observations (rows)
